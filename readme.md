## Image Upload with Laravel

An image upload website built wih laravel framework.

Instructions:
----------

* **First:** Create a Migration file for table 'photos'

*Command:*
```
php artisan migrate:make create_photos_table```


* In this project, we need to use **Intervention/image** package
* Just add ```"intervention/image": "dev-master"```
 in the ```required``` field.

Then update the composer:
```
composer update intervention/image```



Here, after installing the package, when you'll try to access the package, at that time you maybe get an error message.

 To fix this error, we need to change **php.ini** file and uncomment ```;extension=php_fileinfo.dll``` in the *php.ini* file.

* Then add the providers and aliases for image configuration in the ```
app/config/app.php```.

Add this in the ```provider```
 :
```
'Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProvider'```


Add this in the ```aliases```
 :
```
'Image' => 'Intervention\Image\Facades\Image',```


* Create a layout page and create a form to upload the image in the database.
* To upload an image to the server, we need to specify the path. In the ```app/config/image.php```
 configuration file, we specify that,
```
 'upload_folder' => '/uploads/',```

 That means our files will be uploaded to ```'uploads'``` folder that resides in the public directory.

 But when we are uploading the file, we have to specify the full path like this:
 ```
$upload = Image::make($image)
    ->resize(Config::get('image.thumb_width'),Config::get('image.thumb_height'))
    ->save(public_path().Config::get('image.upload_folder').$fullname);```

Here, we have to add ```public_path()```before the ```Config::get('image.upload_folder')```

And also with this code, we can resize the image first and then uploaded the image.
